# VBA-challenge

The script in this program is designed to go through multi-year stock data stored in Excel
The script will begin by looping through all stocks in a given year
For each stock, the script will output Yearly Change, Percent Change, and Total Stock Volume, coloring Yearly Change green or red depending whether the value is positive or negative, respectively
Additionally, the script also keeps track of the stocks with the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and Greatest Total Volume and will output those for each year as well

Testing file and screenshots of the final output file are included with VBA code
